# RickaDex

This is a fun little project fetching from an open Rick And Morty API to display different characters that has appeared throughout the series.

It is fully functional, fully responsive.

The api is as said free, so the quality of the images is medium, but fine.

Problems faced:
With the search function i experienced a issue with it only searching through the current page shown characters.

Solution:
My solution was to create another fetch from the api and using a ternary to choose between the two results.
